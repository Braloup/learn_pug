# learn_pug

##I start to learn pug. I use a freecodecamp free course.

Pug.js is a HTML templating engine, which means you can write much simpler Pug code, which Pug compiler will compile into HTML code, that browser can understand

You can find it at [Learn pug for free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt3cEjjkCZA).

To install pug: npm install pug-cli -g (g flag is for a global instalation)

And for use pug: pug -w ./ -o ./html -P
